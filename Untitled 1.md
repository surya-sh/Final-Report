Sure! Here are the formulas for **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score**, along with the necessary terms:

---

### **Basic Terms**
- **TP (True Positive):** Model correctly predicted positive class  
- **TN (True Negative):** Model correctly predicted negative class  
- **FP (False Positive):** Model incorrectly predicted positive class  
- **FN (False Negative):** Model incorrectly predicted negative class  

---

### **Formulas**

1. **Accuracy**  


2. **Precision**  
\[

\]

3. **Recall** (also known as **Sensitivity** or **True Positive Rate**)  
\[

\]

4. **F1 Score** (Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall)  
\[

\]

Let me know if you want the same for multi-class or macro/micro averaging as well.
